### About
I'm a PhD-student/candidate in Machine Learning at the [Data Science (DaS)](https://www.ru.nl/datascience/) group at the [Radboud University](https://www.ru.nl/). I would call myself a machine learning generalist, but for my PhD I mostly focus on the foundation of Anomaly Detection, and applications to predictive maintenance and power grid management. Some of my research interests (in no particular order) are: Explainable AI, Anomaly Detection, and Reproducible Research. Outside of my research, I boulder, play boardgames, and do some experimental cooking/fermentation.
In a previous life, I studied Chemistry and Molecular Life Sciences, before transitioning to chemometrics (chemical data science), and eventually moving on to more fundamental ML.
