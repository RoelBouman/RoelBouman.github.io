I'm a postdoctoral researcher in Machine Learning at the [Data Science (DaS)](https://www.ru.nl/datascience/) group at the [Radboud University](https://www.ru.nl/). While I would call myself a machine learning generalist, I spent most of my PhD rethinking the foundation of Anomaly Detection, and applying this knowledge across various domains such as predictive maintenance, cyber security, and power grid management. Some of my research interests (in no particular order) are: Explainable AI, Anomaly Detection, Machine Learning Theory and Reproducible Research. Outside of my research, I boulder, play tons of boardgames, and do some experimental cooking/fermentation.
In a previous life, I studied Chemistry and Molecular Life Sciences, before transitioning to chemometrics (chemical data science), and eventually moving on to more fundamental ML.
